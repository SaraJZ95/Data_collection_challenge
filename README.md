# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

This project involves scraping Martian weather data from a provided HTML table, cleaning and transforming the data, and conducting an analysis on Martian temperature and pressure patterns. We use Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Matplotlib to extract and visualize the data. The final analysis includes determining the coldest and hottest months, as well as estimating the length of a Martian year. Solved exercises are saved in `part_1_mars_news.ipynb` and `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`. Data are saved in `mars_weather.csv` and `scraped_data.json`.
